# Art, Science, and Technology: Medial Operations

#### Description

Nowadays, computers are literally everywhere. Through heterogeneous interfaces - such as sensors, transistors, and servo motors - they are inextricably linked to spaces and bodies. As a result, it is difficult to analyse cultural objects independent of their technological apparatus.

Nevertheless, scholars in the humanities are reluctant to learn about the hard-,wet-, and software of art, literature, culture, and politics. In this course we will modestly attempt to compensate for our discipline's technological illiteracy and research the following question:

> What kind of approaches, methods and techniques are needed to analyze the technical dimension of contemporary cultural objects?

Rather than approaching this question from a purely theoretical perspective, we will learn to code ourselves. Programming, however, is not a goal in itself but only a means to an end. We treat code as a particular form of knowledge organization. The goal of this course is not to turn you into a professional programmer, but to provide you with an additional tool to pursue your research.

#### Textbooks

Black, David A. *The Well-Grounded Rubyist.* Stamford: Manning, 2011. Print.

#### Prerequisites

You do not need any experience in coding to follow this course. I do expect you to do some preparatory work, however. Before the first session, you should have completed at least two of the following tutorials:

- Try Ruby: [http://tryruby.org/](http://tryruby.org/)
- Code Academy's Ruby Track: [http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby/](http://tryruby.org/)
- Ruby Monk: [http://rubymonk.com/](http://rubymonk.com/)
- Ruby Koans: [http://rubykoans.com/](http://rubykoans.com/)
- Learn Ruby the Hard Way: [http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/)	

In the break, between the two halves of the semester, you should finish the following two tutorials:

- Try R: [http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r/](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r/)
- Test-First Learn Ruby: [http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby/](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby/)


#### Requirements

In order to successfully complete this course, you have to complete two assignments (40% each) and give a presentation (20%).

Weekly readings, coding exercises, and participation are also mandatory but are not graded individually.
