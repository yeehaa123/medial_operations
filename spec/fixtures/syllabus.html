<h1>Art, Science, and Technology: Medial Operations</h1>
<section class="level3" id="description">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Nowadays, computers are literally everywhere. Through heterogeneous interfaces - such as sensors, transistors, and servo motors - they are inextricably linked our spaces and bodies. It has therefore become almost impossible to analyze cultural objects independent of their technological apparatus. Nevertheless, scholars in the humanities are reluctant to learn about the hard-, wet-, and software of art, literature, culture, and politics.</p>
<p>In this course we will modestly attempt to compensate for our discipline's technological illiteracy and research the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of approaches, methods and techniques are needed to analyze the technical dimension of contemporary cultural objects?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than approaching this question from a purely theoretical perspective, we will learn to code ourselves. Programming, however, is not a goal in itself but only a means to an end. We treat code as a particular form of knowledge organization. Our goal is not to become full-time programmers, but to gain an extra tool to pursue our research.</p>
