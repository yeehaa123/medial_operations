# Art, Science, and Technology: Medial Operations

#### Description

Nowadays, computers are literally everywhere. Through heterogeneous interfaces - such as sensors, transistors, and servo motors - they are inextricably linked to spaces and bodies. As a result, it is difficult to analyse cultural objects independent of their technological apparatus.
Nevertheless, scholars in the humanities are reluctant to learn about the hard-,wet-, and software of art, literature, culture, and politics.

In this course we will modestly attempt to compensate for our discipline's technological illiteracy and research the following question:

> What kind of approaches, methods and techniques are needed to analyze the technical dimension of contemporary cultural objects?

Rather than approaching this question from a purely theoretical perspective, we will learn to code ourselves. Programming, however, is not a goal in itself but only a means to an end. We treat code as a particular form of knowledge organization. Our goal is not to become full-time, professional programmers, but to gain an extra tool to pursue our research.
